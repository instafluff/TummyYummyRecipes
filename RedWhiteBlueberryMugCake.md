## Instructions

1. In a gallon sized ziplock bag, combine the two boxes of cake mix, shake the bag to mix thoroughly. 

2. Lightly coat the inside of a microwavable mug with non-stick spray or use a disposable microwave-safe paper cup. Without the spray the cake will not transfer out of the mug and the mug is harder to clean. If using a microwave-safe paper cup, no spray is needed.

3. (Here comes the 3-2-1:) Into the prepared mug, stir together 3 tablespoons of cake mix and 2 tablespoons of water. Fold in 1 teaspoon of jimmies sprinkles. Add (without mixing) a heaping teaspoon of blueberry filling and a heaping teaspoon of cherry filling.

4. Microwave on high for 1 minute. 

5. Sprinkle the top of the cake with additional cherry pie filling and star sprinkles, then eat it right out of the mug. If you want to transfer the cake onto a plate, run a knife around the edge between the cake and the mug to loosen, dump out onto a place, then add the cherry filling and star sprinkles.
