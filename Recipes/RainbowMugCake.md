## Instructions

1. In a large bowl cream the sugar and butter together until light in colour and fluffy in texture - about 3 minutes. Use a hand whisk.

2. Crack in an egg, mix in well, and follow with the next egg. Then pour in the vanilla extract. Beat for another minute until well combined.

3. Add in the dry ingredients until just combined - don't over-mix! 

4. Divide the mixture as evenly as you can between 5 bowls. 

5. Add a couple of drops of food colouring to each bowl and mix very gently - again, do not over-mix! 

6. Spoon the colors between the 4 mugs one spoonful at a time. Lay the different colored cake batter on top to create a marbled effect. 

7. Microwave for 45 seconds (every microwave is different so cooking may vary). 

8. Take care not to overcook the cake or it will dry out fast. 

9. Decorate your cake with my cream cheese frosting.
